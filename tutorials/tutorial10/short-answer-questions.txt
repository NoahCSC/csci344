Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

Join is getting data from different tables and retrieving them in one query. This is useful because
you organize the data and solve problems.


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
This makes the program more compact allowing the user data to be referenced externally instead of querying every field.
